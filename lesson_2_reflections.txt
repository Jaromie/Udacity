What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository allows me to start version controlling in a folder.
I need it to track afterwards changes in my work with git commits.	

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where I put the file from my working directory that I want to 
commit to my repository.
