When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository as a way to secure my work somewhere, and when I need
to collaborate with people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I do not want to share code which is not ready yet on github.
